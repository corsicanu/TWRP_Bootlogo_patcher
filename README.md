### Instructions:
   - Download latest TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher-*.zip from [releases](https://github.com/corsicanu/TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher/releases)
   - Boot phone in TWRP
   - Flash the downloaded zip as any other
   - Reboot and enjoy

### Further info:
   - If your **exynos** device is not present in the list above, create an [issue](https://github.com/corsicanu/TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher/issues) and tell me more about your device (Model number & possible model variations - F/FN/N/+/e/Ultra/Nfc and so on)
   - In case of reflashing modem/bootloader you will need to reflash this zip to nuke the warnings again (bootloader will overwrite the patch)
   - Any graphical glitch regarding the bootlogo, or any other exotic issue, will be fixed by reflashing bootloader of the specific software version you are running, however, in case you encounter any of those try to submit an [issue](https://github.com/corsicanu/TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher/issues) in which i'll try to assist in fixing

### Patch steps (for nerds):
   - Compatibility Check:
       - Checks if the device is supported based on either the presence of "exynos" or "universal" in the command line or a regex match against a list of supported devices.
   - Tool Preparation:
       - Sets up the necessary tools by cleaning up the temporary directory, creating subdirectories for up_param and param, unzipping the provided ZIP file, and adjusting permissions.
   - up_param Bootlogo Processing:
       - Unpacks the contents of up_param from the device, checks for the existence of a specific warning image, creates a backup of the stock up_param, patches warning images, creates a new tar file, and flashes the new tar file to up_param.
   - param Bootlogo Processing:
       - Unpacks the contents of param from the device, checks for the existence of a specific warning image, creates a backup of the stock param, patches warning images, creates a new tar file, and flashes the new tar file to param.

After these phone will show the logo, a warning containing the normal splash logo and a normal logo with 1px black warning overlay, which will make it look as normal and unrooted/locked bootloader. 

Yes, the warnings are not disabled, more like hidden, the phone will take same time as before to pass the splash screen but at least you won't have the hazard triangle which looks like it's soon going to explode (inb4 Note7, we will miss you).
